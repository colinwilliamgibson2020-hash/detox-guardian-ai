Vision

Detox Guardian is the worldâ€™s first trauma-informed digital recovery ecosystem, born in the UK and launched in Germany under DiGA. What began with one man â€” abandoned after rehab, left with no safety net â€” has grown into a movement that is transforming recovery across Europe.



We believe recovery is not 90 days. It is a lifetime. Detox Guardian provides continuous, 24/7 support, ensuring that no one is ever left to fight addiction alone.



ðŸ”¹ AI-driven care â€“ personalized weekly recovery plans, real-time trigger monitoring, and trauma-informed support.

ðŸ”¹ Family integration â€“ loved ones can safely participate, offer encouragement, and be alerted before relapse risks grow.

ðŸ”¹ Clinical connectivity â€“ seamless integration with doctors, nurses, and rehabilitation centers.

ðŸ”¹ Data sovereignty â€“ full control remains with the user. No selling. No surveillance.



From Germany to the EU and beyond, Detox Guardian is building the first global recovery sanctuary â€” a digital ecosystem that governments, hospitals, and families are already watching.



This is more than a platform. It is a multi-billion-euro vision in the making, a revolution in healthcare, and a lifeline for millions.



Detox Guardian exists for one purpose:

so no family ever has to watch their loved one slip away without hope
